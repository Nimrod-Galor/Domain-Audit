/**
 * TEST FIX PLAN: Twitter Card Analyzer
 * Phase 6 Post-Legacy Removal Test Updates
 */

/**
 * IDENTIFIED ISSUES:
 * 
 * 1. Method Name Mismatches:
 *    - Tests expect: _analyzeAppCard → Actual: _validateAppCard
 *    - Tests expect: _analyzePlayerCard → Actual: _validatePlayerCard  
 *    - Tests expect: _calculateScore → Actual: _calculateComprehensiveScore
 *    - Tests expect: _analyzeImageProperties → Doesn't exist
 *    - Tests expect: _validateRequiredFields → Doesn't exist
 *    - Tests expect: _validateSiteAndCreator → Doesn't exist
 *    - Tests expect: _validateImageUrl → Doesn't exist
 *    - Tests expect: _optimizeTitle → Doesn't exist
 *    - Tests expect: _optimizeDescription → Doesn't exist
 * 
 * 2. Result Structure Changes:
 *    - Tests expect result.score → Actual: result.data.score
 *    - Tests expect direct optimization result → Actual: nested in optimization object
 *    - Tests expect cardType as string → Actual: nested in validation object
 * 
 * 3. Missing Methods:
 *    - Several private methods expected by tests don't exist in optimized analyzer
 *    - Tests may be testing implementation details that were simplified
 * 
 * SOLUTION APPROACH:
 * 
 * 1. Update test method calls to match actual analyzer API
 * 2. Adjust result structure expectations 
 * 3. Focus tests on public API rather than private methods
 * 4. Remove tests for non-existent private methods or add missing methods
 * 5. Update assertion expectations to match new result format
