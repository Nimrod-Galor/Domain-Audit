# 🔧 **Critical Issues Fixed**

## ✅ **Issues Identified & Resolved:**

### 🐛 **Issue 1: `auditExecutor is not defined`**

**Problem:** The AuditExecutor class was imported but never instantiated
**Location:** `routes/audit.js` line 234
**Fix Applied:**

```javascript
// Added after imports
const auditExecutor = new AuditExecutor();
```

### 🐛 **Issue 2: Rate Limiting Too Restrictive**

**Problem:** Rate limit of 5 requests per 15 minutes was too low for development/testing
**Location:** `app.js` rate limiting configuration
**Fix Applied:**

```javascript
max: 20, // Increased from 5 to 20 for development
```

### 🔧 **Additional Improvements:**

1. **Development Utility Route:** Added `/audit/dev/reset-limits` for development
2. **Better Error Handling:** Enhanced error context in logging
3. **Restart Required:** Server needed restart to apply fixes

## 🚀 **Current Status:**

- ✅ **Server Running:** Port 3000
- ✅ **AuditExecutor:** Properly instantiated
- ✅ **Rate Limits:** Increased for testing (20 requests/15min)
- ✅ **Logging:** Capturing all events properly
- ✅ **Direct Access Routes:** Available for testing

## 🧪 **Testing URLs Available:**

- Main interface: `http://localhost:3000/audit`
- Simple audit: `http://localhost:3000/audit/simple/example.com`
- Full audit: `http://localhost:3000/audit/full/example.com`
- Reset limits: `http://localhost:3000/audit/dev/reset-limits`

## 📊 **What Was Causing the Errors:**

1. **Missing Instance:** `auditExecutor` variable was undefined when trying to attach event listeners
2. **Rate Limiting:** Previous requests hit the 5-request limit
3. **Server State:** Old server instance was still running with the broken code

**The audit system should now work properly for testing!** 🎉
