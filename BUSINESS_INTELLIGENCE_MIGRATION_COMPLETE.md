   - Created `src/analyzers/MODULE_ARCHITECTURE.md` with comprehensive architecture documentation
   - Implemented core infrastructure: `BaseAnalyzer.js`, `AnalyzerInterface.js`, `AnalyzerRegistry.js`
   - Organized analyzers into category-based directory structure

2. **Business Intelligence Analyzer Migration**

   - Successfully migrated `BusinessIntelligenceAnalyzer` to extend `BaseAnalyzer`
   - Maintained backward compatibility with legacy `analyzeBusinessIntelligence()` method

3. **Enhanced Integration**
   - Integrate AnalyzerRegistry for centralized management
   - Update enhanced extractors to work with new structure
