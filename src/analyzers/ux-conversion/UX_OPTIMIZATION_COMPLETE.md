✅ UXScoringUtils - Common scoring calculations
✅ UXRecommendationUtils - Recommendation standardization
✅ UXErrorUtils - Safe execution and error handling
📊 Total: 456 lines of reusable utilities
```

### 2. **DETECTOR FACTORY PATTERN**
```
📁 src/analyzers/ux-conversion/core/detector-factory.js

```

### 4. **DOM QUERY OPTIMIZATION**
```
Before: Individual element queries per detector
After:  Batched parallel queries with error handling

🔄 OLD APPROACH:
await page.$('selector1');
await page.$('selector2');
await page.$('selector3');

⚡ NEW APPROACH:
await UXPerformanceUtils.parallelQuery(page, [
  'selector1', 'selector2', 'selector3'
]);
