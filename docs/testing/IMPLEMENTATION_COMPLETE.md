# Testing Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented a **comprehensive and modular testing suite** for the Domain Link Audit tool with professional-grade testing infrastructure.

## üéØ Testing Infrastructure

### Core Setup

- **Jest 30.0.5** with ES modules support (`--experimental-vm-modules`)
- **Playwright 1.54.2** for browser integration testing
- **35 tests passing** across unit and integration test suites
- **Zero test failures** - all tests stable and reliable

### Test Coverage
